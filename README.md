# Python-Mini-Projects
This repository contains a collection of Python projects that utilize INI (Initialization) files for configuration. INI files are simple, human-readable text files used to store configuration settings. They are organized into sections and use key-value pairs, making them easy to read and write programmatically.

## Usage

Explore each project by navigating to its directory. Each project has its own README.md file with instructions on how to use it.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for new mini-projects or improvements to existing ones, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
